## Technologies Used
- Front-end: The site is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes modern front-end technologies like Apollo Client for GraphQL integration, Formik for form handling, and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Back-end: The site interacts with a back-end server that handles user authentication, pet data storage, and database operations. The server is built using Node.js and employs GraphQL for efficient data retrieval and mutation.
- Database: The site leverages a database system to store and retrieve pet and user data. A popular choice for this purpose is MongoDB, a NoSQL database that provides flexibility and scalability.
- Authentication: User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to securely manage user sessions and protect user data.
